It allows you to \"draw\" in 3D space in Blender. It's hard to explain but it essentially lets you create quick, albeit rough 3D sketches and build out interesting organic forms quickly in Blender. It's targeted at concept artists and painters. It allowed me to quickly create a tree in 3D space, light it and bring it into photoshop to adjust and texture it and add it to my scene.

I'm a little slow with it because I'm just getting familiar with the way it works, but I can see how it could help speed the process along once I know what I'm doing. The trick is to keep it simple, knowing that I'm going to be going over everything with more detail in Photoshop.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://smpltn.com/media/posts/34/2021-03-23-2-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://smpltn.com/media/posts/34/responsive/2021-03-23-2-2-xs.jpg 384w ,https://smpltn.com/media/posts/34/responsive/2021-03-23-2-2-sm.jpg 600w ,https://smpltn.com/media/posts/34/responsive/2021-03-23-2-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://smpltn.com/media/posts/34/responsive/2021-03-23-2-2-lg.jpg 1200w\"  height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\" />\n      <figcaption>3D render from Blender</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Once I had the basic block in of the environment and the lighting set up, I went into photoshop to add all the textures and the characters to the environment.
