I love collaborating to generate big ideas and create immersive experiences for the audience. Whether it’s a full-blown visual system for an online brand, a motion graphic piece, or an arresting image, I take pride in doing my part to make sure the customer is absolutely delighted down to the last pixel.</p><p>I can be reached via email at <a href="mailto: rob@robgale.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rob@robgale</a>.</p><p>I got into the digital design business straight out of art school where I studied film and new media. It was the late 90s, and the Web was still a lot like the Wild West. People hadn’t yet developed strong ideas of what was and was not possible, and I loved the energy of discovering this new world, enchanted by the infinite possibilities of the medium. It was a perfect fit for my multi-disciplinary background as an artist, filmmaker and kid who grew up tinkering with computers since my first Apple II+.</p><p>Early in my career I distinguished myself as a designer who could create emotional impact through interweaving image, motion and sound into immersive interactive experiences. I had the opportunity to collaborate on several award winning digital experiences for the entertainment industry, including work on a handful of dream projects for the Star Wars franchise as well as work for EA, New Line, Sony Pictures, and a number of incredible clients.</p><p>As I developed as an artist, I found myself longing for a stronger connection to the fundamental building blocks of visual communication. And so I decided to undertake a rigorous course of study to master the art of drawing, a skill that I consider absolutely fundamental to truly connecting with the human imagination. In an age of computer assisted creative production, I saw that the people who I admired most had this tightly coupled relationship between what they saw in their imagination and what they made with their hands.</p><p>These days my work is a mixture of computer aided design and hand crafted narrative work and a search for the creative spark that is found when worlds collide. It is, in the end, a search for the experience of wonder both in the creative process and in the viewer’s experience of the final product.</p><h3>Partial Client List</h3><div class="post__col-container"><div class="post__2col-item"><div>Electronic Arts</div><div>Jose Cuervo</div><div>J.P.
